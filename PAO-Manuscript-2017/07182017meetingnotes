make new terms for reagions: biotype specific. 
(1) SMR: making limited_to etc = addition of new relationship terms to clarify in tissue instance. 
eld is still fixing up reproductive section
stn will then take over and do muscle and neuro relationships 
SMR will figure out CLpart_of NCBITaxon:XXXX to indentify planariasn specific CL terms 
SMR- specific_to_stage 

GENERAL:addition of manus brought up idea of expanding synonym (ie. racing stripe, belly etc) re parent 
ON TECH: fia suggested in the github to bitbucket switch to have separate repos for indiv pub events 

(1) FURTHER RELATIONSHIPS TO ADD: 
excluded_from
not_present_in
specific_to
limited_to
specific_to 
 
WE NEED CLEAR RULES AND TO REDUCE AUTHORITATIVE STRESS 

WITH RESPECT TO ZFAs post-composed method to deal with composites and reduce granularity:
we have reproducible in situs that show reproducible spatial regions vision(definitive organism subdivision) 
we should be higlighting in the paper that we have spatial regions (neck etc) 

PROBLEM WITH REGIONS! Biotypes.
parapharyngeal region will include testes - but only in sexual- how should we be dealing with this?
has_part  
excluded_from

erin mentions working to make sure parent classes have most basic relationships

parapharyngeal region
has_part peripheral nervous system 
has_part testes  Not in asxual, something about specific to testes 
limted_to

relationships can be qualified - rules can be applied to them. Fia thinks this exists (if not it should).

not all defs have references- that's find for now- but upon next submission we need that to have confidence in the term 


ON SUBMITTING- RULES
highest level of confidence comes from literature

1) in literature (first mention)
2)agreed upon by XXX ? 

minimum requirement:
name
definition
citation

submission without citation:
email addresses of people who support term outside lab
we send email verification?? 

provide alternate justification 

CEBIO star system rating confidence of terms
back at who is the authority here. power to people this way. 

neural plate in ZFA with their anterior and posterior timelines may have key to testes conditional problem. 

ZFA has got around our organization problems with making more child classes (back at duplication)
paraphayngeal reagion
  sexual parapharyngeal region
  asexual parapharyngeal region 
  
  bulkier but more intutive 
  
  PROBLEM SOLVED: duplicate and split as child classes 
  
  uptodate comprehensive and 
  access versions 
  submission of new terms 
  modificaion of existing relationships
  
  we are trying to bring in the peers to input 
  
  DEPICTED_BY
  may create problems with allowing outside sanchez lab to submit- legally w respect to already published images. Work 
  submission and creation fo new term- depicted by submission will be helpful - including rules. 
  
  planosphere to refect ontology, plus information added. 
  
  smed gd2 is out there g browse
  SIMRbase uses Jbrowse
  
  
  Planosphere- the centralized resource? 
  on making more rich pages for terms- will stowers need to hire people to become things like curators? they are tossing this around. 
  add genes to publicatons ( like flybase curators) can tehse people add mroe info to gene pages 
  dbxref with extra stuff added. special grants for resource related. through carnegie. 
  
  key figures from multiple papers. 
  
  depicted by needs legal help. 
  future: x ref link to page on planosphere. 
  can get around this by linking out to info pages hosted elsewhere. ontology defe page has x ref link out.
